Django project deployment in ECS using terraform


deployment of django with nginx and uWSGI on ECS and EC2 ASG(Autoscaling group)


## CICD
when it comes to CICD, we can use multiple tools like Jenkins, githubactions, AWS CodePipeline ... , 
but here I am using Jenkins, and I think the CodePipeline with Codebuild is more expensive that Jenkins instance. 


## NB
1. using nginx along with alb might not be necessary as alb will handle what nginx does.like ssl/tls termination, loadbalancing, routing....
we can leave it out, but I just used it ðŸ˜„


2. this is a general implementation that can be used with any techstack not only for django
 


3. here I am using docker images from dockerhub not from ECR, I want to save my ECR free tier for another side projects, ðŸ˜„
